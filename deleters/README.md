Zero-cost deleter for unique_ptr
================================

This code supports article https://solidabstractions.com/2019/zero-cost-unique_ptr.

Build with `make`.

Beware that the code in `attempt1.cxx` and `attempt3.xx` is INCORRECT. It serves just as illustration purposes, do not re-use it.

The proper way is in `correct.cxx`.
